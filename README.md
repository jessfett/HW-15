## Task

Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset. The dataset provided revealed that a small handful of microbial species (OTUs) were present in more than 70% of the population. 

<b>The interactive dashboard will include the following:</b>
- Dropdown Menu to select Test Subjects
- Interactive Bar Chart 
- Interactive Bubble Chart
- Summary of Selected Test Subject Data

## Codes
The coding is done via an [app.js](https://github.com/jessfett/HW15/blob/main/StarterCode/static/js/app.js) that is embedded into the [index.html](https://github.com/jessfett/HW-15/blob/main/index.html) that uses data with a .json file. Click the embedded links to go to the files.

The interactive dashboard is deployed via GitHub Pages and can be located [here](https://jessfett.github.io/HW-15/).
